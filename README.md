# Audit, monitor and receive notifications from SQL Server table change

SqlTableDependency is a high-level C# component to used to audit, monitor and receive notifications on SQL Server's record table changes.

For any record table change, insert update or delete, a notification *containing values for the record **inserted**, **changed** or **deleted** is received from SqlTableDependency. This notification contains the update values int the database table.

Compared to Microsoft ADO.NET SqlDependency class, this tracking change system has the advantage of avoid a database select to retrieve updated table record state, because this latest table status is delivered by the received notification.

## Track record table change
If we want **get alert about record table changes** without paying attention to the underlying SQL Server infrastructure then SqlTableDependency's record table change notifications will do that for us. Using notifications, an application can **detect table record changes** saving us from having to continuously re-query the database to get new values.

SqlTableDependency's record change audit, provides the low-level implementation to receive database notifications creating SQL Server trigger, queue and service broker that immediately notify us when any record table changes happens.

For any record change, SqlTableDependency's event handler will get a notification containing modified table record values as well as the insert, update, delete operation type executed on our table.
